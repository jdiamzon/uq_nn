This is the code used in producing the results in the paper Uncertainty propagation in feed-forward neural network models. It is in a current state of rewrite, but functions in its current state through the primary use of the three available Jupyter notebooks: the first titled LuxTrainingCUDA.ipynb to train the model on data generated by either the linear or the nonlinear operator. The other two titled `(Non)Linear_Operator_Results` store the main code used to evaluate the results of the linearization method in the paper.

This code relies on various packages, and the biggest contributor is the Lux library in Julia for Scientific Machine Learning. While plots are generated using the Makie library.
